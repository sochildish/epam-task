Task 1

Requirements:
Please implement a method that can fetch and return the temperature of one certain county in China. Here are the specific features: 
•	Feature 1: The method signature is `public Optional<Integer> getTemperature(String province, String city, String county)`.
•	Feature 2: If the location is invalid, return reasonable value.
•	Feature 3: Add reasonable retry mechanism, cause there might be connection exception when calling the weather API.
•	Feature 4: The method need block invocation if the TPS(transactions per second) is more than 100.

Here is the APIs flow that shows how to get the temperature of ‘苏州’：
•	Get the province code of China
o	http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/china.html
•	Get the city code of one certain province
o	http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/provshi/10119.html 
o	‘10119’ is ‘province code’
•	Get the county code of one certain city
o	http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/station/1011904.html 
o	‘1011904’ is ‘province code + city code’
•	Get the weather of one certain county
o	http://www.weather.com.cn/data/sk/101190401.html 
o	‘101190401’ is ‘province code + city code + county code.’

Accepted Criteria:
•	JDK 1.8+ Project (Stream API is required)
•	Build with Maven.
•	Cover all above function requirements.
•	Unit Test (Including both Boundary tests and Exception tests. Success with Junit Assertations.)
